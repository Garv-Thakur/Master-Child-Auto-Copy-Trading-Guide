Theoretically, the Master account does all the trading, and the process is such that the Child accounts take up the same trades instantly. Regardless of whether you are trading or not through Zerodha, Angel One, Alice Blue, or MT4/MT5 platforms, a trusted copier like Combiz Services Pvt Ltd ensures the whole thing is done smoothly, precisely, and lucratively.

This guide is going to take you through the Master-Child Auto Copy Trading system, the tools required, and the setup process explained in steps.

In a matter of seconds, all accounts are ready for automatic copying.

5. Set Up Copy Trading Options

It's time to set up the trade mirroring for each account as follows:

✔ Volume / Lot Multiplier

1x → Exact trade size

0.5x → Half size

2x → Double the Master’s trade

This technique helps in risk balancing across accounts.

✔ Risk Settings

Automatic stop-loss

Automatic take-profit

Maximum loss per day

Lot scaling

✔ Optional Staggering (Prop Firms)

If necessary, delay the trades by 1–3 seconds in order to avoid prop firm bypass flags.

6. Turn on Auto Copy & Track Performance

After the settings have been applied:

Switch ON the auto-copy mode

All trades from the Master account will be reflected instantly on all Child accounts

Daily performance monitoring

Adjusting multipliers in case of necessity
